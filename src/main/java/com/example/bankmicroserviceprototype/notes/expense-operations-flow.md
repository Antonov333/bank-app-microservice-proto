| **Processing**              | Retrieve Currency Exchange Rate<br>Find in DB first, if required data absent refer to external website to retrieve data | Particular entity of Exchange Rate is to be a result of this step. New data retrieved from external is to be saved in database |
|                             | Calculate equivalent USD amount to sum of operation, then keep it and exchangeRateId with Expense Operation entity      |                                                                                                                                |

|                             | Calculate value of Limit Exceeded Flag and set to limitExceeded field of operation entity                               |                                                                                                                                |
| **Saving processed entity** | Save updated entity of Expense Operation in database                                                                    |                                                                                                                                |
